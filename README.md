## Project Overview

## Our Problem Statement

Online shoppers, travelers, and finance enthusiasts frequently see prices listed in foreign currencies when browsing the internet. This creates a challenge in quickly understanding the true cost of products, services, or investments in their home currency. Users often resort to manual conversions using separate apps or websites, interrupting their browsing experience, or rely on mental approximations, which can be inaccurate.

Our target audience for the Currency Converter extension project includes online shoppers buying from international websites, travelers planning trips or purchases in different countries, financial analysts and investors monitoring international markets, students and professionals engaging with international documents and reports, and anyone who might need quick and accurate currency conversions without interrupting their browsing flow.

## Features

- **Real-time price conversion.** Instantly convert prices directly on web pages without navigating away. Up-to-date exchange rates are fetched automatically in the background.
- **All automatic.** Recognizes and highlights prices on web pages for seamless conversion.
- **Manual mode.** You can use a pop-up on your browser to manually convert any prices without navigating away from the page you're on.
- **Extensive currency support.** Provides conversion for a wide range of global currencies, all updated in real-time.
- **Simplicity and fast usability.** The fast rendering simplifies shopping, travel planning, and financial analysis.

## How It Works

The Currency Converter Chrome Extension operates as follows:

1. **Frontend UI.** The extension popup contains a user-friendly interface for selecting currencies and entering the amount to be converted.
2. **Exchange rate API.** The extension fetches real-time exchange rates from a reliable API (that is, [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)).
3. **Conversion logic.** The extension calculates the converted amount based on the fetched exchange rates and displays the result in the popup.
